Always being interested by code, I realized that I wanted to reoriented after gratuated from my communication school. I made that decision to go for what I really want and that's to be a successful Software Developer. I graduated from Le Wagon, a 8-week highly intensive and selective Web Developer Bootcamp that took me from novice to software developer and worked as a Junior Software Developer at Shopmium, Paris. 

I am now seeking for new opportunities in London. I am deeply motivated and confident in my ability to learn quickly any technology.

#### Fast learning

I am enthusiastic about learning and expanding my field of knowledge. My ability to absorb and use information efficiently is a capability that I am proud of having.
